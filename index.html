            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I’m Anwesha — a student, artist, designer, currently exploring Front end development(<strong>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT</strong>) and learning how to bring creative ideas to life through code and design.</p>
            <p>I love blending tech with art, always curious about how things look, feel, and work together. From sketching layouts to writing clean copy or fine-tuning the tiniest design details, i enjoy the full process of bringing ideas to life.</p>
            <p>Besides staring at my laptop screen all day, i can speak spanish (un poquito), breathe iced coffee like it’s air, and honestly don’t trust people who aren’t obsessed with cats.</p>

                <h2>Projects</h2>
                <p>I've also built a couple fun projects through <b>python</b> and <b>C</b>, like<ul><li>an AI powered chess game that makes smart automated moves</li> <li>smart density-based traffic management system that uses sensors to detect vehicle flow and adjusts signal timings accordingly (basically, trying to save the world one traffic jam at a time)</li></ul></p>
